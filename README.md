# learning-golang-todd-mcleod
This is a repo to store all my solutions to exercises from the course [Learn How to Code: Google's Go (golang) Programming Language](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code/) taught by Professor Todd McLeod.

>PS: I haven't watched him solving the exercises, therefore you may find that the solution doesn't necessary mean
>that I have done exactly what he did in the class.
